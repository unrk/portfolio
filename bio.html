        </h1>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Felix, also known online as memoir. I'm 18 years old and live in the suburbs of Paris. I have a
            deep passion for photography and cycling, which have been integral parts of my life. Additionally, I am
            fascinated by development engineering, constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also a melomaniac and audiophile, deeply appreciating music and high-quality sound. I love plants and
            cats, finding joy in their company and care. Despite being quite disorganized at times, I am very dynamic
            and curious, always eager to learn and experience new things.
        </p>
        <p>
            My diverse interests drive me to continuously seek out new challenges and opportunities for growth. Whether
            it's capturing the perfect shot, embarking on a cycling adventure, or diving into a complex engineering
            problem, I approach each endeavor with enthusiasm and dedication.
